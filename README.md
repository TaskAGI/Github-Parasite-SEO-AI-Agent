## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Agent Stops After Processing First Keyword

**Symptom**: Loop node processes only one keyword and then exits.

**Causes**:
1. Loop configuration set to max 1 iteration
2. No additional "draft" keywords found in sheet

**Solutions**:
- Open workflow editor, click on Loop node (Node 2)
- Verify "Max Iterations" is set to 1000
- Check Google Sheet to ensure multiple rows have status = "draft"
- Verify spelling: must be lowercase "draft" not "Draft" or "DRAFT"

#### Issue: "Failed to Generate Content" Error

**Symptom**: Node 3 (Anthropic) fails with API error.

**Causes**:
1. Insufficient Anthropic API credits
2. API key invalid or expired
3. Rate limit exceeded
4. Keyword contains special characters causing prompt issues

**Solutions**:
- Check Anthropic console for remaining credits
- Add more credits if balance is low ($5 minimum)
- Verify API key in TaskAGI integrations page
- Test with simple keywords first (e.g., "SEO tips")
- Wait 1 minute if rate limited, then retry

#### Issue: GitHub Repository Creation Fails

**Symptom**: Node 4 fails with "Repository creation failed" error.

**Causes**:
1. Personal Access Token lacks `repo` permission
2. Repository name already exists
3. Organization name incorrect or no access
4. GitHub account hit repository creation limits

**Solutions**:
- Verify PAT has `repo` scope in GitHub settings
- Check if repository name already exists (delete duplicate or modify keyword)
- Confirm organization name is exact match (case-sensitive)
- Free GitHub accounts limited to certain number of repos per hour‚Äîwait and retry
- Try using personal account instead of organization for testing

#### Issue: "Row Not Found" in Search Sheet Node

**Symptom**: Node 5 cannot find the keyword row to update.

**Causes**:
1. Keyword in sheet has extra spaces or special characters
2. Sheet URL changed or wrong sheet specified
3. Keyword was already updated by previous run

**Solutions**:
- Ensure exact match: no leading/trailing spaces in keywords
- Copy fresh sheet URL and update Node 1 and Node 5
- Check that Column A contains the exact keyword being processed
- Verify sheet has not been deleted or permissions changed

#### Issue: Status Not Updating to "PUBLISHED"

**Symptom**: Repositories created but Google Sheet still shows "draft".

**Causes**:
1. Node 6 configuration pointing to wrong column
2. Sheet permissions are read-only
3. Cell formula preventing update

**Solutions**:
- Verify Node 6 is updating Column B (second column)
- Check Google Sheet sharing settings: TaskAGI account needs "Editor" access
- Remove any formulas from Status column (Column B)
- Manually test: try updating a cell via TaskAGI Google Sheets integration

#### Issue: AI Credits Depleting Too Fast

**Symptom**: Credits running out faster than expected.

**Causes**:
1. Agent running multiple times on same keywords
2. Keywords generating longer content than expected
3. Prompt complexity causing higher token usage

**Solutions**:
- Before running, verify all keywords have "draft" status (avoid reprocessing)
- Monitor first few runs to estimate cost per keyword
- Consider using GPT-3.5 instead of Claude for lower cost (swap Node 3)
- Purchase credits in bulk for better rates
- Set a daily credit limit in TaskAGI billing settings

## FAQ

### What is parasite SEO and why use GitHub?

Parasite SEO is the strategy of publishing content on high-authority third-party platforms to rank faster than your own website. GitHub has a Domain Authority of 90+, gets crawled by Google daily, and has exceptional trust signals. By publishing SEO-optimized content as GitHub repositories, you leverage this authority to rank for competitive keywords that would take months on a new domain.

### How many keywords can I process at once?

The agent supports up to 1,000 keywords per run. However, practical limits depend on your API rate limits, AI credit balance, and GitHub account type. We recommend starting with 10-20 keywords to test, then scaling to batches of 100-500 once you're confident in the workflow. Processing 100 keywords typically takes 15-30 minutes.

### Will Google penalize me for automated content?

Google's guidelines focus on content quality and user value, not how content is created. The agent uses Claude AI to generate unique, well-researched content that follows E-E-A-T principles. Each article is semantically unique and provides genuine value. That said, follow best practices: avoid thin content, don't use exact duplicate prompts for competing keywords, and manually review and enhance high-priority articles after publication.

### Can I customize the content generation prompt?

Yes! The agent template includes a pre-optimized prompt in Node 3 (Anthropic), but you can edit it to match your brand voice, industry, or content requirements. Open the workflow editor, click Node 3, and modify the "Prompt" field. Consider testing changes on a small batch before running large campaigns.

### How long does it take for GitHub repositories to rank?

GitHub repositories typically get indexed by Google within 24-48 hours. Ranking depends on keyword competition, content quality, and existing backlinks. Users report seeing initial rankings (pages 2-5) within 7-14 days for long-tail keywords, with page 1 rankings for low-competition terms within 30-60 days. High-competition keywords may take 3-6 months.

### What's the cost per keyword?

**AI Generation**: $0.015-0.025 per keyword (Anthropic Claude)
**TaskAGI Platform**: Included in subscription ($49/month Personal plan)
**Google Sheets API**: Free
**GitHub API**: Free
**Total**: ~$0.02 per keyword, or $20 per 1,000 keywords

### Can I use this for languages other than English?

Yes! Claude AI supports 95+ languages. Simply provide keywords in your target language in the Google Sheet. The agent will generate content in the same language. Note that SEO effectiveness varies by language‚ÄîGitHub's domain authority is strongest for English-language content, but still provides benefits in other languages.

### Should I use a personal account or GitHub organization?

We strongly recommend creating a dedicated GitHub organization for SEO campaigns. Benefits include: better brand consistency, unlimited public repositories, professional appearance, and easier management of large campaigns. Personal accounts work but may look less credible to users who discover your repositories.

### How do I add backlinks to my money site?

The generated content can include contextual links. To add them: (1) Manually edit repository README files after creation, or (2) Modify the Claude prompt in Node 3 to include placeholders for your target URLs. For example: "Naturally mention and link to {{yoursite.com}} when discussing {{topic}}". Always ensure links are contextually relevant to avoid spam penalties.

### Can I repurpose this agent for other platforms?

Absolutely! The workflow is modular. You can swap Node 4 (GitHub) with other integrations like: WordPress (auto-publish blog posts), Notion (create public pages), Medium (draft articles), or GitLab. The core logic (keyword management + AI generation + publishing) remains the same‚Äîjust change the destination integration.

### What happens if the agent fails mid-run?

TaskAGI tracks execution state. If the agent fails, already-processed keywords will have their status updated to "PUBLISHED" in your sheet. When you re-run the agent, it automatically skips published keywords and continues with remaining "draft" items. No duplicate content or wasted credits.

### How do I track which repositories are performing well?

After repositories are created, you can: (1) Use GitHub Insights to see traffic and clones, (2) Set up Google Search Console to track impressions and clicks, (3) Add UTM parameters to any links in the README to track conversions in Google Analytics, (4) Use third-party SEO tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to monitor rankings for your target keywords.

### Is there a limit to how many repositories I can create?

GitHub free accounts have no hard limit on public repositories but may throttle creation rates (typically ~100 per hour). GitHub Pro accounts have higher limits. If you hit rate limits, the agent will fail with an error‚Äîsimply wait 1 hour and resume. For large campaigns (1000+ repos), consider creating multiple GitHub organizations or spacing out execution over several days.

### Can I schedule this agent to run automatically?

Yes! TaskAGI supports scheduled workflows. Set the agent to run daily, weekly, or monthly. As long as your Google Sheet has "draft" keywords, the agent will automatically process them on schedule. Perfect for ongoing content campaigns where you continuously add new keywords to your sheet.
